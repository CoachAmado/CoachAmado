Hi I'm CoachAmado,

👨‍🎓 Continuous Learner: Currently completing my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certification. I hold a Master of Science in Recreation and Sports Science and an IAAF Level V Academy certification. Always striving for professional development and growth.

🏋️‍♂️ Passionate About Sports and Fitness: With a successful career in strength and conditioning, a winning track and field coaching career, and my current role as a Special Examiner for the FDNY and NYDOS, sports and fitness are integral parts of my life.

🏙️ Dedicated to Community Service: Proud civil servant in the City of New York, committed to urban sports and community health. Passionate about making a positive impact and serving my community.

💪 Resilient and Adaptable: Turned the setback of job loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic into an opportunity for growth and learning. Continuously pushing forward and overcoming challenges.

🎨 Cultural Enthusiast: Deep appreciation for hip-hop culture, fine visual and performing arts, and speculating in art and vintage pop culture collectibles. My appreciation for art and culture fuels my creativity and broadens my perspective.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss sports, fitness, community service, or the arts! Let’s inspire and motivate each other to achieve our goals. 💪🎉
